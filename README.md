# Arabic to English Translation using Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) Model

This repository contains a TensorFlow/Keras implementation of a Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) model for translating Arabic text to English. The model uses an LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture with attention mechanisms to handle the translation task.

## Overview

The Seq2Seq model is a powerful architecture for sequence-to-sequence tasks like machine translation. This implementation uses an LSTM-based encoder to process the input Arabic text and an LSTM-based decoder to generate the corresponding English translation. The model is trained on a dataset of Arabic-English sentence pairs.

## Features

- **LSTM Encoder-Decoder**: The model uses LSTM layers for both the encoder and decoder.
- **Beam Search**: During inference, beam search is used to improve translation quality.
- **Dropout and Early Stopping**: Regularization techniques like dropout and early stopping are used to prevent overfitting.
- **Character-Level Tokenization**: The model operates at the character level, making it suitable for languages with complex scripts like Arabic.
